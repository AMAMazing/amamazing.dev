# My Portfolio - amamazing.dev

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, live at **[amamazing.dev](https://amamazing.dev)**.

It's designed to be a clean, fast, and responsive hub for showcasing my projects and skills.

### A Single Source of Truth

A core concept for this portfolio is the "single source of truth." All the project data (titles, descriptions, links) displayed on the website is hardcoded directly in the `page.tsx` file.

This data is an exact mirror of the content in my main [GitHub profile README](https://github.com/AMAMazing/AMAMazing). This approach ensures that my portfolio and GitHub profile are always consistent, and I only need to update information in one place.

### Technology Stack

I chose a modern, performant stack to build this site:

-   **Framework:** **Next.js** (for its speed and structure)
-   **Language:** **TypeScript** (for type safety and maintainability)
-   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** (for rapid, utility-first UI development)
-   **Deployment:** **Vercel** (for seamless, continuous deployment from this repo)
